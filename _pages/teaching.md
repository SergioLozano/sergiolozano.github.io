For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!

This space is dedicated to sharing practical tools, templates, and other resources developed through real-world experience in product marketing, sales enablement, and customer experience. Whether you're launching a new feature, aligning go-to-market teams, or refining your messaging, these resources are designed to save you time and help you move with clarity.

Each item here has been tested in the field—created to solve problems, improve collaboration, and drive better outcomes across teams. You’ll find content frameworks, enablement kits, positioning guides, and other materials that support the day-to-day rhythm of building, marketing, and selling great products.

Go ahead and borrow them and feel free to explore, adapt, and make them your own.
