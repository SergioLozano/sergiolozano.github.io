Hi, I'm Sergio! üëã I'm a product marketer based in Copenhagen who enjoys breaking down complex products into stories to craft messages focusing on real benefits. 

With over 10 years of experience in B2B marketing and customer experience in the tech industry, I leverage data to position products and storytelling to match customer needs üöÄ An analytical and creative mindset with a commitment to high standards underpin my strategic approach.

Trained in leadership and having managed international teams across different locations, I've developed strong skills in fostering cross-functional collaboration for aligning product, sales, customer success and marketing teams. I enjoy leading by example and embedding empathy into my work style ‚ù§Ô∏è

Others describe me as T-shaped marketer, full-stack product marketing manager, and a product launch wizard ‚ú® But I like to think that I'm a product marketeer clued up in design thinking and with a flair for project management and hungry for data.
