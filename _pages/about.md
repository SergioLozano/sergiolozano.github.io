Hi, I'm Sergio! üëã I'm a product marketer based in Copenhagen who enjoys breaking down complex products into stories to craft messages focusing on real benefits. 

With 10+ years of experience in B2B marketing and CX in the tech industry, I leverage data to position products and storytelling to match customer needs üöÄ An analytical and creative mindset with a commitment to high standards underpin my strategic approach.

Trained in leadership and having managed international teams across different locations, I've developed strong skills in fostering cross-functional collaboration for aligning product, sales, customer success and marketing teams. I enjoy leading by example and embedding empathy into my work style ‚ù§Ô∏è

Others describe me as T-shaped marketer, full-stack product marketing manager, and a product launch wizard ‚ú® But I like to think that I'm a product marketer clued up in design thinking and with a flair for project management and hungry for data.
