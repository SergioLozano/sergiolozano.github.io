Hi, my name is Sergio! I'm a T-shaped product marketeer clued up in design thinking and with a flair for project management. With over 10 years of experience in B2B marketing and customer experience in the tech industry, I offer an analytical mindset and a strong commitment to high standards. Trained in leadership and having managed international teams across different locations, I enjoy leading by example and embedding empathy into my work style.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
