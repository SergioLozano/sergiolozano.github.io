Hi, I'm Sergio! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a product marketeer based in Copenhagen who enjoys breaking down complex products into stories to craft messages focusing on real benefits. 

With over 10 years of experience in B2B marketing and customer experience in the tech industry, I offer an analytical mindset and a strong commitment to high standards. Trained in leadership and having managed international teams across different locations, I enjoy leading by example and embedding empathy into my work style.

Others describe me as T-shaped marketer, full-stack product marketing manager, and a product launch wizard âœ¨ But I like to think that I'm a product marketeer clued up in design thinking and with a flair for project management and hungry for data.
