With complete creative and GTM ownership, I orchestrated a lean but high-impact campaigns that resonated with freelancers and small business owners across Europe.</p> <h2 id="from-messaging-development-to-campaign-production-and-localization-i-owned-the-end-to-end-strategy-the-result-a-memorable-product-video-campaign-that-resonated-with-freelancers-and-small-business-owners-across-europe-and-helped-position-debitoor-as-a-fresh-alternative-to-the-corporate-heavy-accounting-tools-on-the-market">From messaging development to campaign production and localization, I owned the end-to-end strategy. The result: a memorable product video campaign that resonated with freelancers and small business owners across Europe, and helped position Debitoor as a fresh alternative to the corporate-heavy accounting tools on the market.</h2> <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2> <p>Debitoor launched a redesigned mobile app tailored to the needs of European freelancers and SMBs. I led the go-to-market strategy and campaign execution‚Äîfrom crafting the core messaging and value proposition to creating a standout launch video and managing localization in four markets. The campaign emphasized speed, simplicity, and freedom with the tagline: <strong>‚ÄúSend invoices in seconds. Get back to what matters.‚Äù</strong> The campaign increased mobile app downloads, strengthened our market positioning, and showed how a well-aligned GTM strategy can compete with bigger players on a limited budget. ‚Äî</p> <h2 id="context">Context</h2> <p>Before its acquisition by SumUp, Debitoor was a growing SaaS company offering intuitive invoicing software to freelancers and small business owners across Europe. In the second half of 2016, we released a major redesign of our mobile app‚Äîfeaturing a sleeker UI and a faster way to create and send invoices.</p> <p>While the product was significantly improved, we were operating in a crowded space with established players like Sage and QuickBooks. Our edge? A casual, modern brand tone, an intuitive product experience, and a strong base of mobile-first users.</p> <h2 id="we-needed-a-gtm-campaign-that-reflected-this-edge-fast-relatable-and-tailored-to-the-everyday-lives-of-small-business-owners-in-motion">We needed a GTM campaign that reflected this edge; fast, relatable, and tailored to the everyday lives of small business owners in motion.</h2> <h2 id="approach">Approach</h2> <p>With full creative ownership of the campaign, I began by immersing myself in the product. I tested the beta version via TestFlight and spoke with product team members to understand the core ‚Äújob to be done.‚Äù It was clear: users wanted to spend less time creating invoices, and more time running their business, wherever they were.</p> <p>Working with a colleague who shared my passion for hands-on video production, we brainstormed a concept that would feel personal, relatable, and dynamic. Our idea: a point-of-view (POV) video capturing a typical freelancer‚Äôs day in Berlin: riding the U-Bahn, walking through the city, grabbing coffee, playing with a dog, while seamlessly invoicing on the go.</p> <p>I embarked myself on a flight to Berlin, where my colleague was based, and we locked ourselves in a meeting room for two days, finalizing the storyboard and filming everything using just a camera, a smartphone, a homemade green screen, and a lot of creative hustle.</p> <div style="width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;"> <video width="100%" controls=""> <source src="/assets/video/COM-DB5D8362.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> </div> <div class="caption"> This is the original file of the video: filmed in one-shot and using our rudimentary green screen. </div> <p>To bring the campaign to life:</p> <ul> <li> <p>We kept the <strong>video under 30 seconds</strong>, making it perfect for YouTube and Facebook pre-rolls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The video had no voiceover; only light captions and visual storytelling to make it more impactful and make localization easier.</p> </li> <li> <p>We translated the video into four languages (German, Spanish, French, Italian) to support our European audience.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The new campaign slogan? üéØ ‚ÄúSend invoices in seconds. Get back to what matters.‚Äù It emphasized speed, simplicity, and freedom‚Äîthe core values that defined both the product and our users.</p> <hr> <h2 id="output">Output</h2> <p>The final deliverable was a high-impact 30-second video that combined:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Real-life POV footage of urban freelancing life</p> </li> <li> <p>Hands-on use of the app in a way that felt natural, not forced</p> </li> <li> <p>Light comedic elements (like catching a flying apple) to humanize the product experience</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic editing and snappy transitions that matched the app‚Äôs fast, intuitive flow</p> </li> </ul> <p>The video met all objectives:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Showcased key product features in action</p> </li> <li> <p>Delivered the brand message clearly and concisely</p> </li> <li> <p>Adapted easily across platforms and languages</p> </li> <li> <p>Looked polished despite our shoestring production setup</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2> <p>The campaign turned out great, especially if we consider the ROI. The launch video led to a measurable <strong>increase in mobile app downloads across Europe</strong>, particularly in markets like Germany and Spain. It helped reposition Debitoor as a lifestyle-first, mobile-ready invoicing solution for modern entrepreneurs, rather than a dry accounting tool.</p> <p>Just as importantly, the campaign proved that:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Authentic storytelling resonates more than high-budget production</p> </li> <li> <p>Creative resourcefulness can drive great results</p> </li> <li> <p>A deep understanding of your users‚Äô lifestyle can unlock powerful messaging</p> </li> </ul> <p>The campaign set a new bar for how Debitoor approached product launches going forward, and remains one of my proudest examples of low-budget creativity delivering high-impact results.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> ¬© Copyright 2025 Sergio Lozano Alvarez.
