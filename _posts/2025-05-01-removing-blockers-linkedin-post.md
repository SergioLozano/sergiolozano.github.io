We rely heavily on complex systems to do things we could often do ourselves.

On April 28th, a massive power outage in Spain and Portugal reminded me just how fragile our dependencies are. No access to online tools, platforms, TV, or phones, **but the radio was still on**.

So, with this image of people on the streets swarming around a radio to listen to stay informed in my mind, I decided to go back to a time when I was creating content differently: No CMS, just coding it in a mix of markdown and HTML and committing pull requests to GitHub.

You don't need a CMS or a dev team. Go to GitHub, find a template that fits your needs, tweak it to your liking, and you’ve got something that’s *yours*. You own it, you understand it.

This is an example post with some [plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) code.

````markdown
```plotly
{
  "data": [
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [10, 15, 13, 17],
      "type": "scatter"
    },
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [16, 5, 11, 9],
      "type": "scatter"
    }
  ]
}
```
````

Which generates:

```plotly
{
  "data": [
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [10, 15, 13, 17],
      "type": "scatter"
    },
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [16, 5, 11, 9],
      "type": "scatter"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also another example chart.

````markdown
```plotly
{
  "data": [
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [10, 15, 13, 17],
      "mode": "markers"
    },
    {
      "x": [2, 3, 4, 5],
      "y": [16, 5, 11, 9],
      "mode": "lines"
    },
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [12, 9, 15, 12],
      "mode": "lines+markers"
    }
  ],
  "layout": {
    "title": {
      "text": "Line and Scatter Plot"
    }
  }
}
```
````

This is how it looks like:

```plotly
{
  "data": [
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [10, 15, 13, 17],
      "mode": "markers"
    },
    {
      "x": [2, 3, 4, 5],
      "y": [16, 5, 11, 9],
      "mode": "lines"
    },
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [12, 9, 15, 12],
      "mode": "lines+markers"
    }
  ],
  "layout": {
    "title": {
      "text": "Line and Scatter Plot"
    }
  }
}
```
