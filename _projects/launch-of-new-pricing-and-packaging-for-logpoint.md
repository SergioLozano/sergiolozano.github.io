In the first half of 2024, Logpoint, a European cybersecurity company, embarked on a major overhaul of its pricing and packaging model in 2024. Logpoint had been known for its Converged SIEM platform, which combined SIEM, SOAR, and advanced analytics into a single solution. Its customer base spans enterprises, MSSPs, and channel partners, each with different levels of cybersecurity maturity. 

Traditionally, Logpoint offered a bundled solution, but as the market evolved, this rigid structure limited flexibility and scalability. To address these gaps and create a more adaptive offering, I was asked to participate in this new strategy for product packaging and pricing

## TLDR;

In July 2024, I led the go-to-market launch of Logpoint’s new modular pricing and packaging model, moving from a bundled Converged SIEM to a flexible, scalable architecture. I drove cross-functional alignment, created all product messaging, redesigned the website, and led internal enablement. The project launched with only a one-week delay despite late-stage product renaming, and I was recognized for improving team collaboration and delivery under pressure. The initiative enabled more predictable pricing, better product-market fit, and positioned Logpoint for broader adoption among MSSPs and enterprises.

## Context

The existing all-in-one pricing model made it difficult for customers to scale or tailor the product to their needs. As a result, it hindered adoption among smaller security teams and made value communication complex for partners. A modular architecture, centered on a core SIEM and optional add-ons like Automation (SOAR), Case Management, and Behavior Analytics, was needed to meet growing demand for flexibility, support clearer value articulation, and create pricing predictability across segments.

## Approach

I led the end-to-end transition to the new modular model. This included defining product tiers and packaging with internal stakeholders, consulting with analysts to validate pricing strategy, and aligning cross-functional teams. I bridged communication gaps between product and engineering, clarified license and feature naming, and owned all messaging and positioning. I also acted as the main contact for sales enablement—training teams, addressing objections, and ensuring readiness across all regions.

## Output

I executed a comprehensive GTM rollout. This included authoring segmented communications for customers, MSSPs, and partners; leading a full redesign of the website homepage; creating Figma mockups for new content pages; and rewriting all supporting materials such as sales presentations, FAQs, and internal training decks. Every asset was updated to reflect the new product structure and value propositions.

## Outcomes

The launch went live with only a one-week delay, despite a high volume of late-stage changes including product renaming. Internally, I was recognized for positively shaping marketing team collaboration and managing the complexity of cross-team execution. The project laid a foundation for improved scalability, easier onboarding, and better alignment between product offerings and customer needs. Months later, this new strategy reduced the renewals cycle time and increased conversions as the product offering was simplified.
