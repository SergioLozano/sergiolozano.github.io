In 2016, I led a video campaign for the launch of Debitoor‚Äôs redesigned mobile invoicing app, one of the most creatively fulfilling and strategically impactful campaigns of my career. With complete creative and GTM ownership, I orchestrated a lean but high-impact campaigns that resonated with freelancers and small business owners across Europe.

From messaging development to campaign production and localization, I owned the end-to-end strategy. The result: a memorable product video campaign that resonated with freelancers and small business owners across Europe, and helped position Debitoor as a fresh alternative to the corporate-heavy accounting tools on the market.

## TL;DR

Debitoor launched a redesigned mobile app tailored to the needs of European freelancers and SMBs. I led the go-to-market strategy and campaign execution‚Äîfrom crafting the core messaging and value proposition to creating a standout launch video and managing localization in four markets. The campaign emphasized speed, simplicity, and freedom with the tagline:
**‚ÄúSend invoices in seconds. Get back to what matters.‚Äù**
The campaign increased mobile app downloads, strengthened our market positioning, and showed how a well-aligned GTM strategy can compete with bigger players on a limited budget.

## Context

Before its acquisition by SumUp, Debitoor was a growing SaaS company offering intuitive invoicing software to freelancers and small business owners across Europe. In the second half of 2016, we released a major redesign of our mobile app‚Äîfeaturing a sleeker UI and a faster way to create and send invoices.

While the product was significantly improved, we were operating in a crowded space with established players like Sage and QuickBooks. Our edge? A casual, modern brand tone, an intuitive product experience, and a strong base of mobile-first users.

We needed a GTM campaign that reflected this edge; fast, relatable, and tailored to the everyday lives of small business owners in motion.

## Approach

With full creative ownership of the campaign, I began by immersing myself in the product. I tested the beta version via TestFlight and spoke with product team members to understand the core ‚Äújob to be done.‚Äù It was clear: users wanted to spend less time creating invoices, and more time running their business, wherever they were.

Working with a colleague who shared my passion for hands-on video production, we brainstormed a concept that would feel personal, relatable, and dynamic. Our idea: a point-of-view (POV) video capturing a typical freelancer‚Äôs day in Berlin: riding the U-Bahn, walking through the city, grabbing coffee, playing with a dog, while seamlessly invoicing on the go.

I embarked myself on a flight to Berlin, where my colleague was based, and we locked ourselves in a meeting room for two days, finalizing the storyboard and filming everything using just a camera, a smartphone, a homemade green screen, and a lot of creative hustle.

To bring the campaign to life:

- We kept the **video under 30 seconds**, making it perfect for YouTube and Facebook pre-rolls.

- The video had no voiceover; only light captions and visual storytelling to make it more impactful and make localization easier.

- We translated the video into four languages (German, Spanish, French, Italian) to support our European audience.

The new campaign slogan?
üéØ ‚ÄúSend invoices in seconds. Get back to what matters.‚Äù
It emphasized speed, simplicity, and freedom: the core values that defined both the product and our users.

## Output

The final deliverable was a high-impact 30-second video that combined:

- Real-life POV footage of urban freelancing life

- Hands-on use of the app in a way that felt natural, not forced

- Light comedic elements (like catching a flying apple) to humanize the product experience

- Dynamic editing and snappy transitions that matched the app‚Äôs fast, intuitive flow

The video met all objectives:

- Showcased key product features in action

- Delivered the brand message clearly and concisely

- Adapted easily across platforms and languages

- Looked polished despite our shoestring production setup

## Outcomes

The campaign turned out great, especially if we consider the ROI. The launch video led to a measurable **increase in mobile app downloads across Europe**, particularly in markets like Germany and Spain. It helped reposition Debitoor as a lifestyle-first, mobile-ready invoicing solution for modern entrepreneurs, rather than a dry accounting tool.

Just as importantly, the campaign proved that:

- Authentic storytelling resonates more than high-budget production

- Creative resourcefulness can drive great results

- A deep understanding of your users‚Äô lifestyle can unlock powerful messaging

The campaign set a new bar for how Debitoor approached product launches going forward, and remains one of my proudest examples of low-budget creativity delivering high-impact results.
