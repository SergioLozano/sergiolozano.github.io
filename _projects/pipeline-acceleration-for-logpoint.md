In B2B sales, especially in complex industries like cybersecurity, nurturing a Sales Qualified Lead (SQL) through the pipeline can be a slow and fragile process. At Logpoint, a vendor of SIEM and other cybersecurity solutions, this challenge had become especially pressing. Sales cycles were long, progress was inconsistent, and too often, promising leads cooled off due to lack of timely and relevant engagement.

As a strategic product marketer with deep knowledge of both our cybersecurity solutions and our customer segments, I was tasked with creating a scalable, automated campaign to support pipeline acceleration, specifically to keep SQLs warm and moving until sales could engage directly. The campaign became one of our most successful marketing initiatives and contributed to a measurable uplift in conversion rates.

## TL;DR

Faced with an increasingly fragile sales pipeline, I led the design and implementation of a pipeline acceleration campaign at Logpoint. By mapping the end-to-end sales process, applying advanced segmentation through Salesforce, and aligning content with key customer concerns like compliance, I built an automated, personalized email sequence that supported sales outreach without interfering with it. The campaign increased SQL stage-to-stage conversion by 21%, fostered stronger collaboration between Product Marketing and Sales, and introduced a hybrid product-led approach to the sales funnel.

## Context

At the time, Logpoint was expanding its presence across Europe and beyond, offering cybersecurity solutions to enterprise customers, managed service providers (MSSPs), and public organizations. The sales team was managing a growing volume of qualified leads but struggled to maintain consistent engagement due to long sales cycles, regional differences, and limited bandwidth.

The result: leads often went cold between early qualification and deal closure—either due to lack of resources that led to poor timing, generic messaging, or simply a lack of follow-up in conversations with prospects. Additionally, sales interactions varied greatly depending on geography, industry, and whether the lead was a direct customer or a partner. The absence of tailored, automated communication made it harder to scale the sales process.

This was the environment in which I was tasked to intervene, with a goal to keep leads engaged, informed, and confident in Logpoint’s value proposition throughout the pipeline journey.

## Approach

To create a strategic solution, I started with a discovery phase to understand the full sales pipeline and qualification process, engaging directly with sales representatives and managers across markets. I mapped the customer journey from first contact through deal closure, identifying where drop-offs most often occurred and which personas (end-users, partners, public sector, etc.) needed distinct messaging.

Then, using an agile, iterative approach, I built the first version of a multi-touch email nurture sequence tailored to the early stages of the pipeline. Key components included:

- **Segmentation:** Using Salesforce data, I created rules to distinguish between MSSPs, direct customers, public/private sector organizations, and geographies.

- **Personalization:** Each email was dynamically personalized with the appropriate sales manager’s name and email address to create a human connection, even if automated.

- **Contextual content:** The first email paired a relevant customer case study with a reminder about the lead’s upcoming product demo, aligned with their use case and industry.

- **Relevant content:** I would create and repurpose content to adapt it to the needs of the prospect. For example, I would send a customer case before the demo to increase trust, and knowing that compliance was a key concern for many leads, I created a white paper on data integrity, sending it post-demo to reinforce product value in a trusted context. For those who were going through a PoV, I would send them a report on new theats and how to use Logpoint SIEM to detect them.

- **Alignment with sales:** I maintained an ongoing feedback loop with sales and sales engineers, ensuring the timing and messaging of each email supported their real-time conversations without disrupting their workflows.

## Output

The result was a **fully automated, highly segmented email drip campaign** that scaled with our growing sales pipeline. The system ensured that no SQL was left idle without meaningful engagement and that every touchpoint added value and reinforced credibility.

Each sequence was mapped to a specific stage in the pipeline and dynamically adjusted based on lead attributes, ensuring:

- Emails were always relevant and timely

- Messaging reflected real business concerns (e.g., compliance, operational risk, integration ease)

- Sales felt included and supported rather than replaced by marketing automation

Because it was built iteratively, the campaign was also easy to expand and adapt based on performance data and sales feedback.

## Outcomes

Within 3 months of launch, we saw a **21% increase in SQLs moving** from one stage of the pipeline to the next, a significant improvement given the high-value nature of our deals. Beyond performance, the campaign achieved three strategic wins:

- Strengthened the relationship between Product Marketing and Sales by aligning on goals, feedback loops, and shared insights.

- Established a hybrid go-to-market model that combined product-led content with sales-led relationship building, especially powerful in high-touch B2B environments.

- Demonstrated the value of segmented, insight-driven marketing in driving revenue outcomes, leading to broader adoption of similar tactics across Logpoint.

This campaign helped reshape how Logpoint thought about pipeline management—not as a manual, sales-only task, but as a collaborative, scalable, and customer-centered process.
